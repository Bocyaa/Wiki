## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

### Characteristics
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** All APIs of the Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
- **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable:** Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping. This event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
- **Powered by the V8 JavaScript Engine:** The V8 engine, developed by Google for Chrome, compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute, making it extremely fast.

### Capabilities
- **Build Network Applications:** Node.js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js comes with npm, which lets developers install and manage third-party packages to extend their applications. Npm features over 800,000 code packages, making it an invaluable resource for developers looking to add new features.

### Importance in Development
- **Versatility:** Being built on the Chrome's JavaScript runtime, Node.js has a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.
- **Unified Programming Language:** Using Node.js for server-side scripting gives developers the flexibility to use JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end. This design choice allows for a more unified development experience and can decrease the complexity of software systems by reducing the need for different programming languages.
